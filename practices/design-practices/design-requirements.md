# Design Requirements

**Design requirements** list specific criteria that a new product or service must meet in order to be considered successful.

It is essential to identify these requirements up-front, so they can be used to help you design, develop, and evaluate your solution.

There are different types of design requirements. Three key types of requirements are:

1. Functional Requirements
2. Usability Requirements
3. User Experience \(UX\) Requirements

**Functional requirements** specify the functions and features that the solution should have to be useful to the target users. Functional requirements generally focus on making sure the product:

* has the necessary functions to allow users to complete tasks and achieve their goals
* has innovative features that provide additional value to users

**Usability requirements** specify criteria to ensure the solution is easy to use. Usability requirements generally focus on making sure the product:

* is easy to learn and remember
* is efficient and effective to use
* helps prevent and fix user errors

**User experience \(UX\) requirements** specify criteria to ensure the solution is satisfying and enjoyable to use. UX requirements generally focus on making sure the product:

* produces desirable reactions \(such as users feeling confident, engaged, relaxed, happy, etc.\)
* avoids undesirable reactions \(such as users feeling frustrated, bored, annoyed, angry, etc.\)

In addition, other types of design requirements for a solution might include:

* **Data Requirements** \(criteria for data that the solution must gather, process, and store\)
* **Operational and Environmental Requirements** \(criteria for the physical, social, and/or technical conditions that the solution must operate within\)
* **Security and Privacy Requirements** \(criteria for how the solution must protect itself and its data from misuse, attacks, or breaches\) 
* **Legal and Regulatory Requirements** \(criteria that ensure the solution adheres to any relevant laws or regulations\)
* **Maintenance and Support Requirements** \(criteria for how solution will be maintained and supported in the future\)
* etc.
