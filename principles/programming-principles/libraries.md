# Libraries

A programming _library_ is a file of code that contains pre-built objects and functions that you can use in your own appâ€™s code. Everyone uses code libraries - from beginning coders to the most advanced programmers.

The advantages of using a code library include:

* You can reduce the amount of code that you have to write yourself.
* You can create \(and revise\) your app more quickly.
* You can make your app do things that are more advanced than what you could code on your own.
