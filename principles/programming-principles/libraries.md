# Libraries

A programming _library_ is a file of code that contains pre-built objects and functions that you can use in your own app’s code. Everyone uses code libraries — from beginning coders to the most advanced programmers.

The advantages of using a code library include:

* You can reduce the amount of code that you have to write yourself.
* You can create \(and revise\) your app more quickly.
* You can make your app do things that are more advanced than what you could code on your own.

A library is written in a particular programming language, such as JavaScript, Arduino, etc. Some examples of JavaScript libraries include: [ jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [P5](https://p5js.org/), [Phaser](http://phaser.io/), etc.
